      "type": "deck",
      "description": "Commissioned campaigns and music videos where AI-driven workflows solved production bottlenecks—tight timelines, high-quality at scale, and creative consistency. Each piece addresses different use cases: brand films, corporate storytelling, private client work. Challenges included maintaining brand consistency across AI-generated assets and integrating with human-directed creative teams. Credits and roles vary by project.",
      "projects": [
        { "title": "Vuze Apple", "video": "/assets/videos/vuze-apple.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/vuze-apple-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Campaign Film", "description": "You're looking at bold, immersive creative visuals for Vuse—designed for digital displays and interactive installations across UK festivals in Summer 2024. The brief: own the room.\n\nThe pain point: content that holds up at scale, on screens, in crowds, under bright lights. \"Make it immersive\" meant every frame had to earn attention. We built a custom style-transfer pipeline that locked in color, grain, and motion. The result: agency-grade production that felt hand-crafted.\n\nCredits to the Vuse brand team and creative directors." },
        { "title": "Vuze Blueberry", "video": "/assets/videos/vuze-blueberry.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/vuze-blueberry-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Campaign Film", "description": "You're looking at the blueberry variant of the Vuse festival campaign—same UK Summer 2024 rollout across digital displays and interactive installations. The brief: multiple hero assets, fast.\n\nThe pain point: \"We need it yesterday.\" We took learnings from the apple campaign and pushed further—smoother temporal consistency, richer color grading, more controlled motion. AI enabled rapid iteration; no reshoots. The result: a full suite of variants in record time.\n\nCredits to the Vuse brand team for trusting the process." },
        { "title": "Coke Studio Superpop", "video": "/assets/videos/superpop3.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/superpop3-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Superpop Festival Seoul 2023", "description": "You're looking at marketing, event visuals, and creative concepting for Coke Studio's Superpop Festival—a new K-pop festival IP launching in South Korea and Japan in 2023. The brief: create a visual identity that could own the room.\n\nThe pain point: festivals demand volume—digital displays, screens, content loops—and \"we need it yesterday\" is the standard. We delivered a full suite of bold, kinetic assets using AI-driven workflows. The result: a cohesive look that felt premium at scale.\n\nCredits to the Coke Studio team and festival partners." },
        { "title": "Standard Chartered", "video": "/assets/videos/Standard Chartered Bank x Tatler Asia - Live Version.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/Standard_Chartered_Bank_x_Tatler_Asia_-_Live_Version-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Private Equity Gala", "description": "You're looking at a five-minute animation that tells the history of modern banking—commissioned by Tatler Asia for the Standard Chartered Bank Private Equity Gala. The brief: prestige storytelling that could hold a room. The animation was performed live with musicians at galas in Singapore and Hong Kong in 2023.\n\nThe pain point: financial storytelling often feels stiff and lifeless. We used AI to enhance B-roll and maintain style consistency across the full timeline. The result: narrative that earned trust without feeling corporate. What you see above is the live performance.\n\nCredits to Tatler Asia and the production team." },
        { "title": "Historical Reenactment", "video": "/assets/videos/historical-reenactment.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/historical-reenactment-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Private Client", "description": "You're looking at period-accurate footage for a private client—documentary and archival use. The brief: historically plausible visuals without the cost of a full location shoot.\n\nThe pain point: clients want \"it has to look real\" but can't fly a crew to another continent. We solved it with reference-driven generation and careful prompting—every detail vetted for authenticity. The result: footage that passes the eye test and meets archival standards.\n\nCredits to the client for the research and references that made it possible." },
        { "title": "BOX CAR - TAKING OVER (feat. Nessly) [Official Music Video]", "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNg2Y0TJYRk", "subtitle": "Music Video", "description": "You're looking at a full music video for Box Car feat. Nessly—concept, generative visuals, edit. The brief: visuals that could keep up with the track.\n\nThe pain point: \"We want cinematic but we can't afford it.\" Music videos run on tight budgets and tighter timelines. AI let us achieve scope and polish that would've been impossible traditionally. The result: a video that competes with major-label production.\n\nCredits to the artists and label for the collaboration." },
        { "title": "Jacob Sartorius - High (Official Music Video)", "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnE2IBTqDA0", "subtitle": "Music Video", "description": "You're looking at the music video for Jacob Sartorius—\"High.\" The brief: match the track's energy with visuals that feel distinct, not derivative.\n\nThe pain point: artists need to stand out without blockbuster budgets. We built a lean production around AI-generated motion and bold cuts—every frame intentional. The result: broadcast-ready in a fraction of the usual timeline.\n\nCredits to the artist and team for the creative direction." }

The result: smoother motion that feels more natural.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." },
        { "title": "Infinite Zoom", "video": "/assets/videos/exp-infinite-zoom.mp4", "poster": "/assets/images/exp-infinite-zoom-poster.jpg", "subtitle": "Zoom Effect", "description": "You're looking at an infinite zoom experiment—perpetual zoom-out through generative layers. The brief: create seamless, dreamlike scale.\n\nThe pain point: zoom effects often feel artificial or jarring. We blended generative outputs to create a continuous journey. The result: hypnotic, loopable content.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." },
        { "title": "Editorial I", "image": "/assets/images/EditorialTEST_00004_.png", "description": "You're looking at magazine-style imagery from generative models. No client—the brief was curiosity: what happens if we push editorial into AI?\n\nThe pain point: \"AI slop\" vs. something that feels intentional. We learned that subtle cues—lighting, crop, color—make the difference. The result: a workflow that now informs how we approach brand editorial work.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." },
        { "title": "Editorial II", "image": "/assets/images/EditorialTEST_00028_.png", "description": "You're looking at editorial II—pushing style transfer further. The brief: find where coherence breaks so we know the limits.\n\nThe pain point: we need fewer surprises when it matters. This pass revealed what the models could and couldn't hold—insights that now inform every commissioned piece. The result: a map of the edges.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." },
        { "title": "Editorial III", "image": "/assets/images/EditorialTEST_00201_.png", "description": "You're looking at an experiment in color grading and composition—can we steer the palette and layout without losing the model's richness? The brief: rapid concept testing before full production.\n\nThe pain point: content that feels generated, not directed. Strong composition plus controlled color fixed it. The result: a workflow that shapes how we approach client work.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." },
        { "title": "Editorial IV", "image": "/assets/images/EditorialTEST_00403_.png", "description": "You're looking at the final piece in this editorial series. By now we'd learned the rules—so we broke a few. The brief: prove the craft before it lands in production.\n\nThe pain point: the craft in Main Work and Contributing has to come from somewhere. Experiments like this are the foundation—knowing the limits, then pushing past them. The result: high impact from pure R&D.\n\nCredits: solo R&D." }
